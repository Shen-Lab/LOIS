# Train your optimizer 

It is very simple to train your optimizer:

`python train.py --problem=$problem_name --save_path=$path_to_the_saved_model`

where `$problem_name` is the name of your problem (e.g. `$problem_name=square_cos_2d`) and `$path_to_the_saved_model` is the path where your trained model will be saved (e.g. `$path_to_the_saved_model=../trained_models/square_cos_2d`).
